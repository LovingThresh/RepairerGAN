	Idea detail of CycleGAN\hspace{\fill}(\date{May 11, 2022})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For simple segmentation tasks, the generators and discriminators should maintain low complexity.
		\item The complexity between the generator and the discriminator has not been further validated for the medium segmentation task.
		\item For complex segmentation tasks, the generators and discriminators should maintain high complexity.
	\end{itemize}

	Idea detail of Loss Function\hspace{\fill}(\date{May 11, 2022})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Except loss functions of CycleGAN (g\_loss, cycle\_loss, id\_loss), SSIM loss can significantly improve the effectiveness of weakly supervised training.
	\end{itemize}
	\tcbline

	Idea detail of Network Architecture\hspace{\fill}(\date{May 11, 2022})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ConvNext block is better than ResNet block and ResNext block.
		\item Build-in attention is better than other spatial attention.
	\end{itemize}
